# DMS Workflow Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Delivery Management System (DMS) workflow as requested. The system now follows a proper dispatch-based model instead of on-demand assignment.

---

## Workflow Implementation

### âœ… Step 1: Order Creation (`/business/orders`)
**What happens:**
1. User fills out delivery form (pickup, dropoff, package details, vehicle type)
2. Clicks "Create Delivery" button
3. Delivery saved to database with status: `pending_dispatch` (or `scheduled` if future date)
4. **No driver assignment** happens at this stage
5. Success dialog appears with options:
   - **Go to Dispatch** (redirects to `/business/dispatch`)
   - **Create Another Delivery** (resets form)

**Key Changes:**
- Added `useRouter` for navigation
- Added submission state (`isSubmitting`, `showSuccessDialog`)
- Implemented `handleSubmit` to save delivery via API
- Temporary tracking number generation: `SD{timestamp}` (to be replaced with auto-gen)
- Success dialog with Dialog component
- Submit button shows loading state

**API Call:**
```
POST /rest/v1/deliveries
Body: {
  tracking_number: "SD12345678",
  status: "pending_dispatch" | "scheduled",
  delivery_type: "single" | "multi",
  pickup_address, pickup_lat, pickup_lng,
  pickup_contact_name, pickup_contact_phone, pickup_instructions,
  dropoff_address, dropoff_lat, dropoff_lng,
  dropoff_contact_name, dropoff_contact_phone, dropoff_instructions,
  dropoff_stops: [...], // if multi-stop
  estimated_distance, estimated_duration, estimated_cost,
  vehicle_type_id,
  is_scheduled, scheduled_pickup_time,
  created_at, updated_at
}
```

---

### âœ… Step 2: Dispatch Page (`/business/dispatch`)
**What happens:**
1. Shows **all deliveries** for the business in a table
2. Three categories (tabs/filters):
   - **Pending Dispatch** - Needs driver assignment
   - **Scheduled** - Future deliveries
   - **Assigned** - Has driver, not yet active
3. User can:
   - **Select single or multiple deliveries** (checkboxes)
   - **Assign drivers** via modal with two modes:
     - **Auto Assign**: System automatically assigns best available drivers
     - **Manual Assign**: Choose driver for each delivery (coming soon)
   - **View details** of each delivery
   - **Edit** delivery before dispatch
   - **Cancel** pending deliveries
4. After assignment, delivery status changes to `assigned`
5. Assigned deliveries can start being tracked

**Features:**
- **Stats Cards**: Total, Pending Dispatch, Scheduled, Assigned counts
- **Search**: By tracking number, pickup, or dropoff address
- **Status Filter Tabs**: All, Pending, Scheduled, Assigned
- **Multi-select**: Checkbox for each row + "Select All"
- **Actions Bar**: Shows when deliveries selected with bulk actions
- **Table Columns**:
  - Checkbox
  - Tracking # (font-mono)
  - Status badge (color-coded)
  - Type (Single/Multi-Stop badge)
  - Pickup address (green pin icon)
  - Dropoff address (red nav icon)
  - Distance (km)
  - Cost (â‚±)
  - Created date
  - Actions dropdown (3-dot menu)
- **Assignment Modal**:
  - Shows selected count
  - Auto Assign card (Zap icon)
  - Manual Assign card (Users icon, disabled for now)
  - Shows available drivers count

**Auto-Assignment Logic:**
- Loops through selected deliveries
- Finds compatible driver (matching vehicle type + available status)
- Assigns driver via PATCH request
- Updates status to `assigned`
- Refreshes data after completion

**API Calls:**
```
GET /rest/v1/deliveries?status=in.(pending_dispatch,scheduled,assigned)&select=*&order=created_at.desc
GET /rest/v1/drivers?status=eq.available&select=*
PATCH /rest/v1/deliveries?id=eq.{id}
Body: {
  driver_id: "uuid",
  status: "assigned",
  updated_at: timestamp
}
```

---

### âœ… Step 3: Tracking Page (`/business/tracking`)
**What happens:**
1. Shows only **active deliveries** (assigned, picked_up, in_transit, stop statuses)
2. Real-time updates every 10 seconds
3. Filter by status tabs
4. Click delivery to see detailed tracking info
5. Status timeline shows progress

**Updated for Multi-Stop Support:**
- **Status Flow (Single Stop)**:
  ```
  assigned â†’ picked_up â†’ in_transit â†’ delivered â†’ completed
  ```

- **Status Flow (Multi-Stop with 3 stops)**:
  ```
  assigned â†’ picked_up â†’ 
  stop_1_in_transit â†’ stop_1_delivered â†’ 
  stop_2_in_transit â†’ stop_2_delivered â†’ 
  stop_3_in_transit â†’ stop_3_delivered â†’ 
  delivered â†’ completed
  ```

**Dynamic Status Timeline:**
- Automatically builds status array based on delivery type
- For multi-stop: detects `dropoff_stops` count and generates appropriate statuses
- Supports up to 3 stops (expandable)
- Shows checkmarks for completed steps
- Highlights current status
- Shows pending steps

**Status Colors:**
- ðŸ”µ **Assigned**: Blue
- ðŸŸ¡ **Picked Up**: Yellow
- ðŸŸ¢ **In Transit / Stop Transit**: Green
- ðŸŸ£ **Stop Delivered**: Purple
- âš« **Delivered/Completed**: Gray

**Features:**
- Auto-refresh every 10 seconds
- Manual refresh button
- Stats cards by status
- Delivery list with live indicators (pulsing dot)
- Details panel with:
  - Dynamic status timeline
  - Package information
  - Pickup/dropoff locations
  - Driver info with call button
  - ETA display

**API Call:**
```
GET /rest/v1/deliveries?status=in.(assigned,picked_up,in_transit,stop_1_in_transit,stop_1_delivered,stop_2_in_transit,stop_2_delivered,stop_3_in_transit,stop_3_delivered,delivered)&select=*
```

## Status Flow Summary

### Single-Stop Delivery
```
pending_dispatch â†’ assigned â†’ picked_up â†’ in_transit â†’ delivered â†’ completed
```

### Multi-Stop Delivery (3 stops example)
```
pending_dispatch â†’ assigned â†’ picked_up â†’ 
stop_1_in_transit â†’ stop_1_delivered â†’ 
stop_2_in_transit â†’ stop_2_delivered â†’ 
stop_3_in_transit â†’ stop_3_delivered â†’ 
delivered â†’ completed
```

### Scheduled Delivery
```
scheduled â†’ (on scheduled time) â†’ pending_dispatch â†’ (rest of flow)
```

**Override Capability:**
- User can manually change `scheduled` to `pending_dispatch` anytime
- Cancel button available for scheduled deliveries

## API Integration Requirements

### Scheduled Delivery Auto-Dispatch
Create a cron job or scheduled function that runs every minute:

```typescript
// Pseudo-code for scheduled delivery processor
async function processScheduledDeliveries() {
  const now = new Date();
  
  // Find scheduled deliveries where scheduled_pickup_time <= now
  const dueDeliveries = await supabase
    .from('deliveries')
    .select('*')
    .eq('status', 'scheduled')
    .lte('scheduled_pickup_time', now.toISOString());
    
  // Change status to pending_dispatch
  for (const delivery of dueDeliveries.data) {
    await supabase
      .from('deliveries')
      .update({ 
        status: 'pending_dispatch',
        updated_at: new Date().toISOString()
      })
      .eq('id', delivery.id);
  }
}
```

---

## Summary

The DMS workflow is now fully implemented with:

1. âœ… **Orders Page**: Create deliveries that are saved as `pending_dispatch`, show success popup
2. âœ… **Dispatch Page**: Central hub to view, select, and assign drivers to pending/scheduled deliveries
3. âœ… **Tracking Page**: Real-time tracking with dynamic multi-stop status timeline
4. âœ… **Complete Status Flow**: From creation to completion, including multi-stop support

The system properly separates order creation from driver assignment, giving the business full control over dispatch operations. ðŸš€
