# ✅ App Mockup Update - COMPLETE

## What I Did

Changed the homepage app mockup section to perfectly showcase **YOUR 2 actual app screenshots** instead of 3 placeholder frames.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Mockup Section Design

**Before:** 3 phone frames with placeholders
**After:** 2 phone frames with your real app screens

**New Features:**
- ✨ Section header: "Experience SwiftDash"
- 📱 Two phones displayed side-by-side
- 🎨 Gradient background (background to secondary/20)
- 📐 Realistic phone frames with notches
- ↔️ Tilt effect: Left phone -6°, Right phone +6°
- 🖱️ Hover interaction: Phones straighten on hover
- ⚡ Fast loading with priority optimization

### 2. Better Layout

**Left Phone (app-home.png):**
- Your home screen image
- Shows "Track Live", "Quick Actions" section
- Rotated -6° for dynamic look

**Right Phone (app-order.png):**
- Your order summary image  
- Shows pricing and delivery details
- Rotated +6° for dynamic look
